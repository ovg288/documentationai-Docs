## Overview

Ctxfy turns raw AI conversations and documents into reusable context. Organize work in **Spaces** → **Collections** → **Sources** → **Artifacts**. Upload raw input, extract structured context and artifacts, use across projects. Measurable benefits from day one—see [Why Ctxfy?](/help-center/faq/why-ctxfy).

## Spaces

A **space** is a project container. Use spaces to organize snapshots and keep context isolated. Each user owns spaces and can create, list, update, and delete them. All other resources (collections, sources, artifacts) belong to a space.

| Method | Path | Description |
|--------|------|-------------|
| POST | /api/v1/spaces | Create space |
| GET | /api/v1/spaces | List user's spaces |
| GET | /api/v1/spaces/:spaceId | Get space |
| PUT | /api/v1/spaces/:spaceId | Update space |
| DELETE | /api/v1/spaces/:spaceId | Delete space |

## Collections

**Collections** provide hierarchical organization inside a space. They form a tree via `parentId`. Use them to group sources (e.g. by project, topic, or folder).

| Method | Path | Description |
|--------|------|-------------|
| POST | /api/v1/spaces/:spaceId/collections | Create collection |
| GET | /api/v1/spaces/:spaceId/collections | Get collection tree |

## Sources

A **source** is raw input you upload for processing—AI conversations, documents, URLs, or files. It has a `type`, processing `status`, and optional `collectionId`. Types:

| Type | Description | `initial_data` |
|------|-------------|----------------|
| **URI** | Web URL | `url` or `uri` (required) |
| **FILE** | Uploaded file | `data` — fileKey from POST /upload/s3 response |
| **CONTENT** | Pasted content (e.g. AI conversation) | `data` |
| **COMPOSITION** | Combined sources | `source_ids` (array) |

### Source status

`CREATED` → `PENDING` → `PROCESSING` → `COMPLETED` | `FAILED` | `CANCELED`

### Source actions

| Action | Path | Description |
|--------|------|-------------|
| Create | POST /spaces/:spaceId/sources | Create source |
| Get | GET /sources/:sourceId | Get source |
| Update | PATCH /sources/:sourceId | Patch metadata |
| Delete | DELETE /sources/:sourceId | Soft delete |
| Pin | PATCH /sources/:sourceId/toggle-pin | Toggle pin |
| Restore | POST /sources/:sourceId/restore | Restore deleted |
| Reprocess | POST /sources/:sourceId/reprocess | Re-run pipeline (COMPLETED/FAILED) |
| Cancel | POST /sources/:sourceId/cancel | Cancel processing |
| Refresh | POST /sources/:sourceId/refresh | Re-fetch (URI/FILE only) |

## Artifacts

**Artifacts** are extracted outputs from sources—code, schemas, diagrams, and structured context. They have status: `CREATED`, `PENDING`, `PROCESSING`, `REVIEW`, `COMPLETED`, `FAILED`.

| Method | Path | Description |
|--------|------|-------------|
| GET | /api/v1/spaces/:spaceId/artifacts | List artifacts |
| PUT | /api/v1/source-artifact/:artifactId/process | Start processing |
| PUT | /api/v1/source-artifact/:artifactId/promote | Promote to space (optional: title, description) |

## S3 Upload

For file-based sources, use the presigned upload flow:

1. `POST /api/v1/upload/s3` with `filename`, `contentType`, `size`
2. Receive `uploadUrl`, `publicUrl`, `fileKey`
3. `PUT` file to `uploadUrl`
4. Create source with type `FILE` and `initial_data: { "data": "<fileKey>" }`

Requires API key authentication. Rate limits apply (Free: 10/min, Pro: 100/min).
