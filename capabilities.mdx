## How this maps to the API

- **Spaces, collections, sources** — Organize and ingest content; the pipeline runs on sources you create. See [Concepts](/concepts#sources).
- **Artifacts** — Extracted outputs (code, schemas, diagrams); list, process, and promote via API. See [Concepts](/concepts#artifacts).
- **Authentication and rate limits** — [Authentication](/authentication); Free 10 req/min, Pro 100 req/min.
