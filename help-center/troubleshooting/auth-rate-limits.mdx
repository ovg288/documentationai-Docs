## 401 Unauthorized

### Token expired

Firebase ID tokens expire. Refresh the token or obtain a new one from your Firebase client. For API keys, ensure the key has not been revoked.

### Missing or malformed header

Use exactly: `Authorization: Bearer <token>` with a space before the token. Do not omit `Bearer` or use different header names.

### Wrong token type

Ensure you are using a valid Firebase ID token or a User API key. Other JWT formats are not accepted.

## 429 Too Many Requests

### Rate limit exceeded

- **Free plan:** 10 requests/minute  
- **Pro and above:** 100 requests/minute  

Response headers: `X-RateLimit-Limit`, `X-RateLimit-Remaining`, `X-RateLimit-Reset`. On 429, the `Retry-After` header indicates when to retry.

### Mitigation

- Implement exponential backoff.
- Batch requests where possible.
- Consider upgrading the plan for higher limits.
