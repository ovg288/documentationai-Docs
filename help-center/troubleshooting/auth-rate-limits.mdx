## 401 Unauthorized

### Key expired or revoked

API keys may have an expiration date. If expired, or if the key was revoked, create a new key in the Ctxfy dashboard.

### Missing or malformed header

Use exactly: `Authorization: Bearer <api_key>` with a space before the key. Do not omit `Bearer` or use different header names.

### Invalid key

Ensure you are using a valid API key created in the Ctxfy dashboard. Copy the key exactly; any typo will result in 401.

## 429 Too Many Requests

### Rate limit exceeded

- **Free plan:** 10 requests/minute  
- **Pro and above:** 100 requests/minute  

Response headers: `X-RateLimit-Limit`, `X-RateLimit-Remaining`, `X-RateLimit-Reset`. On 429, the `Retry-After` header indicates when to retry.

### Mitigation

- Implement exponential backoff.
- Batch requests where possible.
- Consider upgrading the plan for higher limits.
