## Is my data secure?

Yes. We use industry-standard encryption for data at rest and in transit. Your snapshots are yours alone.

## Do you train on my data?

**No.** We never train our models on your data. Your content is used only to provide the service. You maintain full ownership of everything processed through Ctxfy.

## Can I export my data?

Yes. You can export your context snapshots at any time. No lock-in. If you cancel your subscription, you keep access to existing data and can download it whenever you need. We ensure full portability of your captured context.

## Where is data stored?

Data is stored on secure cloud infrastructure. Enterprise customers can discuss private deployment options and data residency requirements with our team.
