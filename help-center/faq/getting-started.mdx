## What is Ctxfy?

Ctxfy is AI context management for professionals. The API lets you save conversation state as snapshots, extract structured context and artifacts, and organize work in Spaces. Use it to automate context capture and integration with your AI tools.

## How do I authenticate?

Use `Authorization: Bearer <api_key>` on every request. Create API keys in the Ctxfy dashboard. Each key grants access to all resources of the key owner.

## What is the base URL?

Use the URL of your deployment (e.g. `https://api.ctxfy.com` or the host provided to you). Public endpoints like `/health` and `/metrics` do not require auth.

## What are the rate limits?

- **Free plan:** 10 requests/minute  
- **Pro and above:** 100 requests/minute  

Check `X-RateLimit-Remaining` and `Retry-After` on 429 responses.

## Where is the full API spec?

See the [API Reference](/authentication) tab and the OpenAPI specification (`openapi.yaml`). All endpoints under `/api/v1` are documented there.
