## What is ctxfy-vault?

ctxfy-vault is the HTTP API for the knowledge base: spaces, collections, sources, artifacts, and S3 uploads. Use it to integrate document processing and AI workflows into your app.

## How do I authenticate?

Use `Authorization: Bearer <token>` on every request. Two options:

- **Firebase ID Token (JWT)** — for user-facing apps; get the token from Firebase Auth.
- **User API Key** — for scripts and server-side; create via `POST /api/v1/api-keys` (requires Firebase JWT). The raw key is returned only once.

## What is the base URL?

Use the URL of your deployment (e.g. `https://api.ctxfy.io` or the host provided to you). Public endpoints like `/health` and `/metrics` do not require auth.

## What are the rate limits?

- **Free plan:** 10 requests/minute  
- **Pro and above:** 100 requests/minute  

Check `X-RateLimit-Remaining` and `Retry-After` on 429 responses.

## Where is the full API spec?

See the [API Reference](/authentication) tab and the OpenAPI specification (`openapi.yaml`). All endpoints under `/api/v1` are documented there.
