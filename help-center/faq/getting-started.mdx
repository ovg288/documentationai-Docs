Ctxfy is AI context management for professionals. Save your AI conversation state as snapshots, resume any project in 30 seconds, cut token costs by 65–75%. Works with ChatGPT, Claude, and any AI tool. The API lets you automate context capture and integrate with your workflows.

## Who is it for?

Professionals and teams using AI daily: developers, architects, product managers. Anyone with long, decision-rich conversations who needs to preserve and reuse context across sessions. API access is available on Pro and Enterprise plans.

## How do I authenticate?

Use `Authorization: Bearer <api_key>` on every request. Create API keys in the Ctxfy dashboard. Each key grants access to all resources of the key owner.

## What is the base URL?
