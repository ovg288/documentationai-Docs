## What problem does Ctxfy solve?

Your AI conversations disappear. Decisions get lost. Code gets buried in 200-message threads. Re-reading and reconstructing context wastes hours every week. Ctxfy solves this by capturing your AI conversation state as structured snapshots—preserving decisions, code, and reasoning in a compressed format you can paste into any fresh chat.

## How does context compression work?

Ctxfy extracts the critical state from your conversations—decisions, constraints, working state—and generates a compressed version (typically up to 75% smaller). You paste it into a new AI chat; the AI instantly recovers full context without wasting tokens on repetitive explanations.

## Who is Ctxfy for?

Professionals and teams using AI daily: developers, architects, product managers, content strategists. Anyone who has long, decision-rich conversations with AI and needs to preserve and reuse that context across sessions and projects.
