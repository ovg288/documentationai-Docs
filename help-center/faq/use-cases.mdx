## What works best?

Ctxfy works best with **long, decision-rich conversations**:

- **Software architecture discussions** — Preserve design decisions, constraints, and trade-offs.
- **Feature planning** — Capture requirements, acceptance criteria, and scope decisions.
- **Code reviews** — Extract feedback, patterns, and follow-up items.
- **Content strategy sessions** — Keep tone, structure, and editorial guidelines in sync.
- **Complex problem-solving** — Retain reasoning chains and step-by-step conclusions.

Short, single-question chats typically don’t need compression—Ctxfy shines when context accumulates and re-reading becomes costly.

## Use the API to automate

The API lets you:

- **Capture context programmatically** — Ingest conversations from your tools, CI/CD, or scripts.
- **Bulk process** — Upload and process many sources at once.
- **Integrate with workflows** — Trigger processing when new conversations or documents arrive.
- **Build custom dashboards** — Query spaces, sources, and artifacts for reporting.
