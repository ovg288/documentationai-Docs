## Ctxfy API documentation

This documentation describes the Ctxfy HTTP API for AI context management. Content is kept in sync with the service specification (`.cerses/service.md` and `.cerses/api-documentation.yaml` in the main repository).

## Content you can edit

- Page content: edit `.mdx` files in this repo.
- Navigation: update `documentation.json`.
- API reference: the API Reference tab is generated from `openapi.yaml`. Copy from `.cerses/api-documentation.yaml`, then apply Public Doc rules (Ctxfy title, API keys only), remove internal references (RMQ, workflows, rmq.md, system services), and fix `CollectionTreeResponse` circular ref.
