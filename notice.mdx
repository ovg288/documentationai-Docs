## Ctxfy API documentation

This documentation describes the Ctxfy HTTP API for AI context management. Content is aligned with:

- **Technical and business source:** `docs/service.md`, `docs/business-process-documentation.md`, `docs/api-documentation.yaml` in the host repository (ctxfy-vault). Use for API contract, concepts, quickstart.
- **Marketing and features source:** `docs/marketing-hub/` (features, clusters, messaging). Use for value propositions, Capabilities page, and FAQs.

## Content you can edit

- Page content: edit `.mdx` files in this repo.
- Navigation: update `documentation.json`.
- API reference: the API Reference tab is generated from `openapi.yaml`. Copy from `docs/api-documentation.yaml`, then apply Public Doc rules (Ctxfy title, API keys only), remove internal references (RMQ, workflows, rmq.md, system services), and fix `CollectionTreeResponse` circular ref if present.
